// orionldContextPrefixExpand -
//
// This function looks for a ':' inside 'name' and if found, treats what's before the ':' as a prefix.
// This prefix is looked up in the context and if found, the name is expanded, replacing the prefix (and the colon)
// with the value of the context item found in the lookup.
//
// NOTE
//   * URIs contain ':' but we don't want to expand 'urn', not' http', etc.
//     So, if 'name' starts with 'urn:', or if "://" is found in 'name, then no prefix expansion is performed.
//
//   * Normally, just a few prefixes are used, so a "prefix cache" of 10 values is maintained.
//     This cache is local to the thread, so no semaphores are needed
//
