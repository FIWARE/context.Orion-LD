//
// qBuild - build QNode tree
//
// DESCRIPTION
//   'q' filters are used for querying entities (GET /entities, POST /entityOperations/query) and
//   for subscriptions/notifications.
//
//   For entity queries, the filter is parsed, used and thrown away - kalloc is used.
//
//   However, for subscriptions:
//   - the filter needs to be expanded and saved in the database
//   - the filter needs to ba allocated and stored in the subscription cache (for GET /subscriptions ops)
//   - the resulting QNode tree needs to be allocated and stored in the subscription cache
//
//   At startup, when the subscription cache is populated from the database content, the same applies (for subscriptions).
//   As well as for regular sub-cache refresh operations.
//
//   We assume for now that "GET /subscriptions" operations always use the sub-cache.
//
// PARAMETERS
//   q          the string as it figures in uri param or payload body
//   qRenderP   output parameter for the prepared filter (expansion, dotForEq, '.value')
//   v2ValidP   output parameter indicating whether the q string id valid for NGSIv2
//   isMdP      output parameter indicating whether the q para meter corresponds to 'mq' in NGSIv2
//
