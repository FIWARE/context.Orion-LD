# libmicrohttpd and the two callbacks for:
#   * Request Received
#     1. START:   Headers+URI Params
#     2. READING: Paylad Body Chunks
#     3. DONE:    Entire Request Received
#
#   * Request Completed
#     4. The response has been sent
#
# As an extra detail, Orion cannot return a response (which is done via MHD, of course)
# until the ENTIRE REQUEST HAS BEEN RECEIVED.
# So, errors found in "START" and "READING" must be stored and not sent until we're in "DONE".
#
#
# Actions taken in each of these 4 steps:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 1. Request Received: START
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   * ciP = new(ConnectionInfo)  (Big malloc - but Orion depends on it, especially MongoBackend - Orion-LD some day will not need it)
#   * orionldStateInit()
#   * verbGet() - checks for invalid verb
#   * serviceLookup(VERB, URL)
#   * Retrieve/Check all URI Params
#   * Retrieve/Check all HTTP Headers
#
# 2. Request Received: READING
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   * Allocate memory for the payload body buffer (only first time and only if > 32k)
#   * Copy the payload body chunk into its place in the payload body buffer
#
# 3. Request Received: DONE
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   * Check that all present URI params are supported by the service (the service was looked up in "START")
#   * If 'tenant' given, make sure it exists (not for all requests - not for creation of entities, subscriptions, and registrations)
#   * Check for empty payload for POST/PATCH/PUT
#   * PARSE the Payload Body + numerous checks
#   * Check for valid Content-Type and Accept HTTP headers (+ @context in payload body vs HTTP header)
#   * Treat inline context (parse + add to context cache)
#   * CALL THE SERVICE ROUTINE
#   * Add GEO-index if necessary
#   * Add tenant if necessary (to the brokers 'tenant cache')
#   * If reponse payload body (GET or Any Error) - serialize the KjNode tree info JSON text
#   * RESPOND to the caller
#   * Call the corresponding TRoE function (if turned on) - to populate the TRoE tables
#   * Cleanup
#
# 4. Request Completed
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   * This is where I will send the notifications, once Orion-LD starts notifying without the help of mongoBackend
#   * More cleanup
#   * Performance, Statistics and Metrics (if turned on)
