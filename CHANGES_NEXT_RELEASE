* Issue #1034  Fixed a bug about Array Reduction and Concise Attribute Format
* Issue #1045  Fixed bug related to TRoE and creation of entity without attributes

* Issue #903   SSL connection, etc for mongoc - NOTE: not for legacy driver - only the new, experimental API endpoints (needs testing)
* Issue #1151  GET /entities?id=X is NO LONGER translated to GET /entities/X - that was a BAD IDEA

* Issue #280   Timestamp support in RANGE in 'q' for subscriptions
* Issue #280   Support for NOT EQ for range in 'q' for subscriptions

New Features:
* Concise input/output format - more compact but still lossless - see NGSI-LD API spec v1.6.1 for details
* URI parameter options=simplified as an alias to options=keyValues
* Support for the OPTIONS method for all NGSI-LD API endpoints
* 'notifierInfo' and 'receiverInfo' for subscriptions

Replacing the deprecated MongoDB C++ Legacy driver with the newest MongoDB driver (mongoc v1.22.0):
* Common functions for Getting and Listing tenants now use the new mongo driver
* Common functions for Geo indices now use the new mongo driver
* Common function for creation of the _id.id entities index now uses the new mongo driver
* Using the tenant list when populating the subscription cache instead of querying the database (less Mongo C++ Legacy driver usage)
* GET /subscriptions/{subId} now uses the subscription cache and no database access is done (less Mongo C++ Legacy driver usage)
* GET /subscriptions now uses the subscription cache and no database access is done (less Mongo C++ Legacy driver usage)
* Subscription Cache now uses mongoc and not the old legacy driver
* Subscription Cache Counters are now updated using mongoc and not with the old legacy driver
* PATCH subscriptions/{subId} now uses the new mongoc driver

Experimental Features (to turn on - start the broker with `-experimental`).
Note that this is experimental implementations, not yet thoroughly tested.
_They all pass the basic functional tests, and seem to work just find, but, no promises made._
* Fresh implementations of services using 'mongoc' (the new MongoDB driver) instead of mongoBackend+Legacy driver:
  * PUT    /entities/{entityId}     (not supported if -experimental is not used)
  * PATCH  /entities/{entityId}     (not supported if -experimental is not used)
  * POST   /entities                (two versions: legacy and mongoc - mongoc version if -experimental is used)
  * GET    /entities                (two versions: legacy and mongoc - mongoc version if -experimental is used)
  * GET    /entities/{entityId}     (two versions: legacy and mongoc - mongoc version if -experimental is used)
  * POST   /subscriptions           (two versions: legacy and mongoc - mongoc version if -experimental is used)
  * DELETE /subscriptions/{subId}   (two versions: legacy and mongoc - mongoc version if -experimental is used)
* Support for LanguageProperty attributes
* Support for URI parameter 'observedAt' for PATCH /entities/{entityId} in combination with options=keyValues - update existing observedAt sub-attributes
