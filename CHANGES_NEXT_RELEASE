## Fixed Issues:
  #1621: URL-Encoding single quote in attribute values in TRoE DB
  #1649: Crash when using subscriptions in a mixed environment (LD and V2)
  #1682: Default User Context 

## New Features:
  * Native support for DDS (off by default - to activate use CLI: -wip dds)
  * Distributed subscriptions: subordinate subscriptions are DELETED when their "father" is deleted.
  * Support for the URL parameter 'csf' in GET /ngsi-ld/v1/csourceRegistrations
  * Support for the URL parameter 'orderBy' (must be an attribute) in GET /ngsi-ld/v1/entities, but only if 'local' is set. (This is not NGSI-LD standard. Yet ...)
    - Also supporting sorting on entity id, type, and modifiedAt
    - One more URL parameter '?reverse=true' to reverse the sorting order
  * Support for GET /ngsi-ld/v1/info/sourceIdentity
  * Support for management::localOnly in registrations
  * Support for new CLI parameter '-pageSize' to set the default pagination limit (default is 20 if -pageSize is not used)

## Notes
  * Lots of improvements for subordinate subscriptions - still not 100% ready, but a lot better.
