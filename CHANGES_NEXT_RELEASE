## Fixed Issues:
  * #1535:  Ignore Subscription::q when matching subscriptions for deletion of an entity
  * #1542:  Array Reduction (arrays of one single element are "flattened" to that very element)
  * #1551:  format=simplified for distribute GET /entities gave Normalized for entities from other brokers
  * #1573:  pagination not working when entities have the exact same creation date (sort also by entity id)
  * #1583:  If a 'q' contains an ampersand, that ampersand needs to be forwarded as a semicolon
  * #1593:  Modify the type of an entity in a Replace operation (only working in legacy mode)
  * #1612:  Support for ISO8601 timezones expressed in +/- HH:mm in 'q' for entity query

  * Fixed a possible crash for TRoE and attributes of type Vocab/Json/Language
  * Forbidden to DELETE the Core Context !!!  (it can be reloaded)
  * Bug fix: JSON NULL literal is no longer forwarded!

## New Features:
  * Support for attributes of type VocabularyProperty
  * Support for attributes of type JsonProperty
  * Support for the new URL parameter "format" for output formats (normalized, concise, simplified)
  * New service: DELETE /ngsi-ld/v1/entities  (URL param 'type' only - the rest are missing still)
  
## Notes
  * TRoE is still not prepared for attributes of type Vocab/Json/Language, so, attributes of those types are not stored in the historical database
  * Modified the @context hosting feature to be according to API spec
  * Support for URI param 'kind' for GET Contexts
  * Improved counters for GET Context/Contexts
  * API spec compliance for GET Context/Contexts
