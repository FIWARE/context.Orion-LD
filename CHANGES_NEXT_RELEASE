## Fixed Issues:
  * #1535:  Ignore Subscription::q when matching subscriptions for deletion of an entity
  * #1542:  Array Reduction (arrays of one single element are "flattened" to that very element)
  * SOF:    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77911109/fiware-to-payload-too-large
  * #1551:  format=simplified for distribute GET /entities gave Normalized for entities from other brokers
  * #1573:  pagination not working when entities have the exact same creation date (sort also by entity id)

## New Features:
  * Support for attributes of type VocabularyProperty
  * Support for attributes of type JsonProperty
  * Support for the new URL parameter "format" for output formats (normalized, concise, simplified)
  * Support for JsonProperty attribute type
  * Fixed a possible crash for TRoE and attributes of type Vocab/Json/Language
  * Forbidden to DELETE the Core Context !!!  (it can be reloaded)

## Notes
  * TRoE is still not prepared for attributes of type Vocab/Json/Language, so, attributes of those types are not stored in the historical database
  * Modified the @context hosting feature to be according to API spec
  * Support for URI param 'kind' for GET Contexts
  * Improved counters for GET Context/Contexts
  * API spec compliance for GET Context/Contexts
