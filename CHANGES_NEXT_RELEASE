## Fixed Issues:
  * #1535:  No matching with 'q' when matching subscriptions for deletion of an entity
  * #1542:  Array Reduction (arrays of one single element are "flattened" to that very element) 

## New Features:
  * Support for VocabularyProperty
  * Support for the new URL parameter "format" for output formats (normalized, concise, simplified)
