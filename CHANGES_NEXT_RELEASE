## Fixed Issues:
  * #1535:  No matching with 'q' when matching subscriptions for deletion of an entity
  * #1542:  Array Reduction (arrays of one single element are "flattened" to that very element) 

## New Features:
  * Support for VocabularyProperty
  * Support for the new URL parameter "format" for output formats (normalized, concise, simplified)
  * Support for JsonProperty attribute type
  * Fixed a possible crash for TRoE and attributes of type Vocab/Json/Language

## Notes
  * TRoE is still not prepared for attributes of type Vocab/Json/Language, so, attributes of those types are not stored in the historical database
