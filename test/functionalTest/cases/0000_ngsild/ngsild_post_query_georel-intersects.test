# The Geometries are:
# - R  [[ [1,4], [1,6], [3,6], [3,4], [1,4] ]]
# - L  [ [2,2], [4,2], [5,4], [7,4] ]
# - P  [ 8,7 ]
#
# There will be three different type of Query over each Geometry:
# - Match
# - No Match due to position
# - No Match due to Geometry Type (For Overlap to match, the Geometry Type must coincide as well)
#
#
# 01. Create entity ER, with a geo-property geo that is the Polygon R
# 02. Create entity EL, with a geo-property geo that is the LineString L
# 03. Create entity EP, with a geo-property geo that is the Point P
#
# 04. Post Query for overlap with Query-Polygon [[ [3,4], [3,8], [4,8], [4,4], [3,4] ]] - see entity ER
# 05. Post Query for overlap with Query-LineString [ [2,2], [7,2] ] - see entity EL
# 06. Post Query for overlap with Query-Point [8,7] - see entity EP
