Alternative Context implementation - inline context

#
# The idea of this test is to make sure the expansions are done from the correct context.
# An entity is created with a simple inline key-values context, containing:
#   - 'avg'   (that also is part of the Core Context)
#   - 'avg2' (that only exists in the inline context)
#
# The entity has three attributes:
#   - 'avg'  - that should be expanded according to the Core Context as it overrides the inline context.
#   - 'avg2' - that should be expanded according to the inline context as it figures there but not in the Core Context.
#   - 'avg3' - that should be expanded according to the Default URL as avg3 doesn't exist in any of the contexts of the request.
#
# After creation, we look at the mongo content and make sure all three long names for avg, avg2, and avg3 are correct
# The third part is to GET the entity, without any context (i.e. the Core Context) and we should see avg (expanded by Core context)
# and 'avg3' (expanded by Default URL) as short names, while 'avg2' should come back as longname as 'avg2' would need the inline context of the creation
# in order to be compacted.
#
# The fourth and last part is to issue another GET but this time using the inline context of the creation (Step 01).
# This time we should see all three attributes in compact form.

#
# After this, the exact same test is performed, but with a slightly more complex inline context.
# This inline context is an array of a string (a URL, pointing to a context), and the same inline context as when creating entity E1:
#
# "@context": [
#   "https://fiware.github.io/NGSI-LD_TestSuite/ldContext/testFullContext.jsonld",
#   {
#     "A": "http://from.inline.context2/types/A",
#     "avg": "http://from.inline.context2/attributes/avg",
#     "avg2": "http://from.inline.context2/attributes/avg2"
#   }
# ]
#
# Steps 5-8 should behave exactly as steps 1-4
#
# - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
# 
# Now we create an entity E3, that has the same context as Step 2, but we add an attribute (one that is matched in https://fiware.github.io/NGSI-LD_TestSuite/ldContext/testFullContext.jsonld).
#
# This is the context https://fiware.github.io/NGSI-LD_TestSuite/ldContext/testFullContext.jsonld:
#
#   "@context": [
#     "https://fiware.github.io/NGSI-LD_TestSuite/ldContext/testContext.jsonld",
#     "https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context.jsonld"
#   ]
#
# The Core Context will be removed from the vector and we pick the name "" from NGSI-LD_TestSuite/ldContext/testContext.jsonld.
#
# Thus, E3 will have the following attributes:
# 
#   - 'avg'  - that should be expanded according to the Core Context as it overrides the inline context.
#   - 'avg2' - that should be expanded according to the inline context as it figures there but not in the Core Context.
#   - 'avg3' - that should be expanded according to the Default URL as avg3 doesn't exist in any of the contexts of the request.
#   - 'P1'    - that should be expanded according to the context "NGSI-LD_TestSuite/ldContext/testContext.jsonld": http://example.org/P1
#
# After creation, we see the mongo content and this time we do three GET requests:
# - without context                                   - see avg and avg3 compacted 
# - with the context of Step 01                       - See avg, avg2, and avg3 compacted. Not P1
# - with the creation context of Step 9 (creating E3) - see all four attribute avgs compacted

# 03. Get E1 with only Core Context - see avg and avg3 compacted, avg2 as long avg from the inline context in step 1
# 04. Get E1 with the context of the entity creation in Step 01 - see all three attributes in compact form

# 06. See E2 in mongo
# 07. Get E2 with only Core Context - see avg and avg3 compacted, avg2 as long name from the inline context in step 1
